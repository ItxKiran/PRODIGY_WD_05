# Exploring Weather with APIs: A Prodigy Task

This project was undertaken as part of a Prodigy task to enhance skills in web development and API integration. The goal was to create a dynamic web page that fetches real-time weather data based on user input or their current location.

## Key Features

- **Location Detection:** Utilizes the browserâ€™s geolocation API to automatically detect and display the user's current location.
  
- **User Input:** Provides users the option to manually input any location worldwide to retrieve comprehensive weather data.
  
- **API Integration:** Integrates a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the web page is fully responsive across various devices for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
  
- **API Management:** Utilizes Axios for efficient handling of API requests and responses.

## Learning Outcomes

This project significantly enhanced my skills in frontend development, particularly in working with APIs to dynamically fetch and present real-time data. It deepened my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript operations and reinforced principles of responsive web design.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements may include adding features such as historical weather data, extended forecasts, and interactive data visualization to provide users with deeper insights into weather patterns.
